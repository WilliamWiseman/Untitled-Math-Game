<h1>WELCOME EDUCATORS</h1>
	<p>You may be confused as to what the heck this all is. That's what this page is for!</p>
	<p>First, this game is HIGHLY customizable. All you need to do is give William Wiseman a slip of paper.</p>
	<p>On this slip of paper you have to put 3 things.</p>
	<p>First, I will need your email. This way I can send it to you.</p>
	<p>Second, I need questions and answers. Sadly I cannot include images due to data issues.</p>
	<p>Third, I would love any customizations you want. I can change anything.</p>
	<p>Sorry if you don't like that the score is aneurysms. I will change it.</p>
<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
	<p>First, get your own special copy of the game.</p>
	<p>Next, you need to share the file, which is in your drive, to all of your students.</p>
	<p>In order to play the game, your students must download the copy from their drive</p>
	<p>Then they must click on the file in their files to open it.</p>
